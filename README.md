## Description of Techniques

### Filter Visualization
Filter visualization involves visualizing the filters of a CNN to understand the types of features the network learns. This is typically done by optimizing input images to strongly activate specific filters, revealing the patterns each filter is sensitive to.

### Filter Activation Visualization
Filter activation visualization focuses on visualizing the activation maps produced by CNN filters for a given input image. This helps in understanding how different parts of the image influence the filter responses.

### Filter Maximisation
Filter maximization is the process of generating images that maximize the activation of a particular filter. This helps in identifying the ideal input patterns that a filter is most responsive to.

### Class Maximisation
Class maximization involves generating images that maximize the activation of a particular class score. This technique is used to understand what a network has learned to recognize as a specific class.

### GradCAM
GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a technique that produces heatmaps highlighting the important regions in an input image that influence the CNN's decision. GradCAM++ and FasterScoreCAM are advanced variations that offer improved localization and explanation capabilities.
